# CSCI-603ComputationalProblemSolving
This course focuses on applying computational thinking to solve problems. Algorithm expression in pseudo-code and a programming language; basic data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs; recursive problem solving; and debugging and testing are among the subjects covered. The course includes assignments (both in class and at home) that require a pseudo-code solution and implementation in a programming language.
