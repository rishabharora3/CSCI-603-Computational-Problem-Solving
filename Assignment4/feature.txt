Two additional features in spellfixer.py to check for incorrect spelling:

1: Removal of extra letter
	
	The logic will check, after removing one letter in the word at each index with the list of legal words.
	Example: input-->  asssignment
		output--> assignment


2: Adjacent letter check

	The logic will swap each adjacent letter in the word and check the updated word against the list of legal words.
	Example: input--> helol
		output--> hello
